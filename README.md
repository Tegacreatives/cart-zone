## Why I built this project

My goal is to understand the process of building a full stack application and get more familiar with backend technologies. For now I focus on front-end development but plan on going full-stack eventually.

## Technologies I used for the project

 I'm building this project based on a Dribbble design by [Musemind](https://dribbble.com/shots/19604000-E-Commerce-Website-Design-Multi-Product)
 
 I'm using [Next.js(React)](https://nextjs.org/) for the front-end and MongoDB Atlas for my database.
 
 [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/) is my prefered CSS framework for styling, it's easy and flexible to use
 
 I use [Next Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) for user authentication
 
 I use the [useRducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) and [useContext](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext) for the application logic and state management

I plan on using [Testing libary](https://testing-library.com/) to write test codes

## My Future plans for the project are

To keep updating the project

Refactoring some of the code to make it more understandable

Adding tests to the project

## How to get the project

 Download the project as zip or clone it, go into the project directory and run:
